## :trident: FAQ

**I'm getting "Idle" value at Process list**
This happens when your process is not available anymore and the program still showing yet, but the next refresh will remove it.

**There's any Android version?**
We have plans to build up a Android version as soon as possible.

**Why haven't auto refreshs?**
We are aiming the people that haven't a good computer too, so, we disabled the automatic refresh for the best experience.
